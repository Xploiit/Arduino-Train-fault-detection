# Arduino-Train-fault-detection
Arduino Based Train Fault Detection and Reporting system. This was implemented using Thingspeak as the reporting mechanism. This system checks fault on a moving train and report it to a train station and uploads all data readings to an IOT Thingspeak for them to know the state of the train.
